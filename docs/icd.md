## Frameworks

See the High-Level Services ICD.

## REST

### Files

Filename | Description
--- | ---
`openapi/types.rs` | Data types used for REST requests and replies.
`cargo-rest/src/lib.rs` | Imports the REST types file to create the `svc-cargo-client-rest` library, usable by other Rust crates.
`cargo-grpc/src/grpc.rs` | Autogenerated GRPC client stubs usable by other Rust crates to easily communicate with the GRPC server of this service.

### Authentication

See the High-Level Services ICD.

### Endpoints

:construction: This API will move to a more readable format.

| Endpoint | Type | Arguments | Description |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| `/cargo/query` | POST | vertiport_depart_id<br>vertiport_arrive_id<br>timestamp_depart_min<br>timestamp_depart_max<br>timestamp_arrive_min<br>timestamp_arrive_max<br>cargo_weight_kg | Queries for a flight with the given characteristics
| `/cargo/confirm` | PUT | flight_plan_id | Customer confirmation of a possible flight plan
| `/cargo/cancel` | DELETE | flight_plan_id | Cancel a flight plan
| `/cargo/vertiports` | POST | latitude, longitude | Get vertiports for a user


## GRPC

### Files

These interfaces are defined in a protocol buffer file, [`grpc.proto`](../proto/grpc.proto).

### Integrated Authentication & Encryption

See Services ICD.

### GRPC Server Methods ("Services")

GRPC server methods are called "services", an unfortunate name clash with the broader concept of web services.

| Service | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `IsReady` | Returns a message indicating if this service is ready for requests.<br>Similar to a health check, if a server is not "ready" it could be considered dead by the client making the request.

### GRPC Client Messages ("Requests")

| Request | Description |
| ------    | ------- |
| `FlightQuery` | A message to the svc-scheduler in particular
